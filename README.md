## Design-Patterns

___________________________

**Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

#### Template Method

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.

It uses **Hollywood Principle** which states, "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You.". It's closely related to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
The template method call the algorithm methods in the subclass, no the opposite.
